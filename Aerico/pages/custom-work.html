        <h1>Aii-CARC-1 // Testing Media CARC</h1>
        <p><b>Chemical Agent Resistant Coating Testing Media</b></p>
        <p>CARC is a low gloss military version of the polyurethane paints that were developed for use in commercial industry. CARC has a low porosity that prevents chemical warfare agents from “soaking in” to the finish and makes decontamination easy to perform.  More importantly, the CARC finish is not affected by the solvents used in the decontamination process.</p>
        <p>The CARC finish is more durable and resistant to fading, lasting up to four times longer than the alkyd paint previously used by the Military. This durability promised to keep fielded vehicles looking better for a longer period of time and to reduce the number of times a vehicle would need to be repainted in its life cycle, thus reducing maintenance costs. The resistance to solvents allows regular washing of vehicles without fear of damaging the finish.</p>

        <h1>Aii-DAAMS // Depot Area Air Monitoring Systems</h1>
        <p><b>Depot Area Air Monitoring System (DAAMS)</b></p>
        <p>DAAMS is a portable air sampling unit that draws a controlled volume of air through a glass tube filled with a sorbent material. Chemical agent vapors are collected on the sorbent material. Sampling times vary from as few as 30 minutes to 12 hours. After sampling is complete, the tubes are removed from the DAAMS station and sent to the laboratory for analysis within 72 hours.</p>
        <p>While many of these DAAMS units are no longer in production, Aerico has developed a solution to refurbish and perform maintenance on DAAMS units, providing extra life and use.</p>
